    I would like to write a python script that will leverage pyqt5 for a GUI interface and what this program will do is take a snapshot of all open windows and processes to then be restored back to after a system reboot for lets say critical updates..  So, for example, a user leaves email windows open to keep track of what he/she has responded to and what still needs to be done, they can go to the restore point after the reboot and it will automatically open everything that was open durring the snapshot process.

That sounds like a great project! You'll need to:

    Capture Open Windows & Processes
        Use psutil to get running processes.
        Use pygetwindow or win32gui (on Windows) to capture open window titles and their associated processes.

    Store the Snapshot
        Save the list of open processes and window states (titles, positions, etc.) to a file (JSON or SQLite).

    Restore the Windows After Reboot
        After reboot, read the saved snapshot.
        Use subprocess.Popen to relaunch saved applications.
        (Windows) Use pygetwindow or pywinauto to reposition windows if necessary.

    PyQt5 GUI
        Display current open windows and processes.
        Allow users to take snapshots and restore from them.

Would you like a basic starting template for the PyQt5 GUI?
You said:
yes, and this will be more focused on Windows than any other OS

Here's a basic PyQt5 template to start your project. This script will:

    List all open windows and processes.
    Allow the user to take a snapshot.
    Store the snapshot in a JSON file.
    Provide a button to restore windows after a reboot.

I'll set this up with pygetwindow, psutil, and subprocess to manage processes.

This script will:

    Capture all open windows and their associated processes.
    Store the snapshot in snapshot.json.
    Restore the processes after a reboot by relaunching them.

Let me know if you'd like any modifications, such as better handling of window positions!
